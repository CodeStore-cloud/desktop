This directory contains libraries that are not available in the Maven Artifactory and are installed
by the `maven-install-plugin`.

## notnull-instrumenter-maven-plugin
File: `notnull-instrumenter-maven-plugin-1.1.2-SNAPSHOT.jar`

This plugin is used to processes `@NonNull` and `@Nullable` Annotations.
The currently available version in Maven does not support Java 21 yet, so this is a custom build that supports
Java 21.
